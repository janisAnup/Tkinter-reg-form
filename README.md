Tkinter Registration Form

🎯 A simple and stylish registration form built using Python's Tkinter library.

🛠️ Features:
- User-friendly GUI
- Entry fields for registration details
- Styled using a separate `designs.py` file for cleaner code
- Modular structure

📂 Files:
- `main.py` — main application logic
- `designs.py` — holds all the styling for the form
- `README.md` — you're reading it 😉
